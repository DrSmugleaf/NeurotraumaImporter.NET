Arterial ruptures are extremely dangerous and require emergency care as soon as possible. Applying a Tourniquet to the afflicted limb can buy you time to treat it, but this should not be done on the head. The arteries which may rupture include the carotid artery on the head, brachial arteries of the arms, and femoral arteries of the legs. Rupture of the torso artery is an Aortic Rupture.


<span style="font-size: 18px">Caused by:</span>
- Bleeding (80% or more)
- Traumatic Amputation
- Foreign Bodies (20% or more)
- Chance when breaking a bone

<span style="font-size: 18px">Effects:</span>
- 1.5% Blood Loss per second (doesn't give more than 99.5% blood loss)

<span style="font-size: 18px">Treatments:</span>
- Open Close Surgery

<span style="font-size: 18px">First Aid:</span>
- Tourniquet(except for carotid artery rupture)

Clamped bleeding is caused by using a Tourniquet on an extremity (except the head) with an Arterial Bleeding. It is removed upon completing an Open Close Surgery on the affected limb.


<span style="font-size: 18px">Caused by:</span>
- Tourniquet

<span style="font-size: 18px">Effects:</span>
- Prevents Arterial Bleeding from causing Blood Loss
- Causes Gangrene after a period of time

<span style="font-size: 18px">Treatment:</span>
- Open Close Surgery

Gangrene is a rare occurrence, and only occurs due to neglecting an applied Tourniquet , Endovascular Balloon or Sepsis . Once gangrene hits 15%, it is irreversible and the limb must be amputated.


<span style="font-size: 18px">Caused by:</span>
- Leaving a Tourniquet on for too long
- Leaving a Endovascular Balloon in for too long
- Sepsis (5% or more)

<span style="font-size: 18px">Effects:</span>

Plaster casts are extremely important for treating limb Fractures. Assuming the config is unchanged, getting a fracture on a limb that is already casted will break the cast. Plaster casts can be removed with Trauma Shears .


<span style="font-size: 18px">Caused by:</span>
- Applying Gypsum to a limb with Bandaged

<span style="font-size: 18px">Effects:</span>
- Slowly treats limb Fractures by 0.33% per second

Surgical amputation is the amputation of an extremity. Possible amputations include arms, legs, and the head. The head cannot be reattached after amputation. Unlike traumatic amputations, surgical amputations will not cause Arterial Bleeding upon first acquiring them.

<span style="font-size: 18px">Caused by:</span>
- Amputation Surgery

- 2 leg amputation will ragdoll you and remove your ability to speak.

<span style="font-size: 16px">In arm amputations:</span>
- 1 arm amputation will prevent you from using that arm (you cant hold 2-handed items anymore
- 2 arm amputations will prevent you from interacting with anything, such as doors, ladders, buttons, etc.

Traumatic amputation is the non-surgical amputation of an extremity. A traumatic amputation will act the exact same as a Surgical Amputation , besides from the fact that you will acquire Arterial Bleeding upon first getting amputated. A limb must be fractured in order to become traumatically amputated.

##  Burning
Caused by fires, the patient will gain Burns over time. A character affected by burning will scream (unless they are [painless](https://trello.com/c/vnbRSZz6/51-analgesia "?")) and be visibly lit on fire.


<span style="font-size: 18px">Causes:</span>
- Standing in a fire

First degree burns are minor and can usually be ignored, but second degree burns and higher require medical intervention, lest the patient risk contracting an infection. Burns between 1-20% strength are first degree, 21-50% are second degree, and 51% and onwards are third degree. The sum of acid burns and regular burns will be accounted in its degree. It is important to note that, unlike other traumatic afflictions which directly affect vitality, burns will never appear on the Health Scanner.


<span style="font-size: 18px">Effects:</span>
- Direct damage to vitality
- Turns Bandages dirty (speed depends on how severe the burns are)
- Infected Wounds (scales depending on how severe the burns are)

<span style="font-size: 18px">Treatments:</span>
- Bandages or Plastiseal **(ONLY FOR FIRST AND SECOND DEGREE BURNS)**
- Open Close Surgery (apply Plastiseal before Sutures, works on any degree burns)
- Antibiotic Ointment **(ONLY FOR FIRST AND SECOND DEGREE BURNS**)
- Antibiotic Glue (works on any degree burns)
- Combat Stimulant (works on any degree burns)

Foreign bodies are often acquired after firefights or being caught in an explosion. Foreign bodies should be removed as quickly as possible in order to avoid Arterial Bleeding or the patient contracting Sepsis. Each use of tweezers will remove 3-10% foreign bodies. The chance of foreign bodies causing issues scales with time and the strength, as shown in the graph at the bottom of this card.


<span style="font-size: 18px">Caused by:</span>
- Explosions
- Gunshots (gunshots that break a bone will always cause foreign bodies)

<span style="font-size: 18px">Effects:</span>
- Arterial Bleeding (at 20% or more)
- Aortic Rupture (at 20% or more, if in the torso)
- Sepsis (at 20% or more)

This mechanic is off by default. It can be toggled in the mod's config, found in the ESC menu while the mod is enabled.
Organ rejection may occur when a patient receives an organ transplant while their Immunity is higher than 10%. If organ rejection occurs, the organ that was transplanted will immediately gain 100% damage, making it useless.
Reducing Immunity is primarily done using Azathioprine.
At 100% Immunity, the chance for organ rejection is 60%. The formula, where 1 is 100%, is as follows:

The second step in **all** surgical procedures. Having an unclamped (no Clamped Bleeding) surgical incision will cause 0.7% Blood Loss  per second for each incision, and having a surgical incision without Analgesia or another sedation method ( Unconsciousness or Anesthesia) will cause 2% Traumatic Shock per second for each incision.

Traumatic shock can rapidly become fatal, and should your patient acquire this at any point, it is likely to be unintended. Traumatic shock will decrease in strength 4x as fast provided the victim is under the effects of Anesthesia, or has Analgesia while being near a Surgery Table.
If a character has Retracted Skin and the round ends (such as on docking to a station), the character will gain 5 minutes of traumatic shock immunity on the next round.


<span style="font-size: 16px">Caused by:</span>
- Performing unsafe surgery:
  - Surgery Incision without Analgesia
  - Any other surgical step after Clamped Bleeders without sedation, such as being near a Surgery Table or having Anesthesia.
- Using Tweezers  through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries (causes minor shock unless overused)

<span style="font-size: 18px">Effects:</span>
- Hypotension  (and lots of it)
- Cardiac Arrest  (at 40% or more)
- Respiratory Arrest  (at 30% or more)
- Neurotrauma  (equal to strength divided by 100 per second, 10% or more is the point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- Psychosis (equal to strength divided by 100 per second)

<span style="font-size: 18px">Treatments:</span>
- Terminating the surgery and waiting
- Bringing into proximity of a Surgery Table and making sure the patient is sedated

<span style="font-size: 18px">Prevention:</span>
- Making sure that the surgery is safe before proceeding beyond the Retracted Skin step
- Making sure Analgesia or other forms of sedation don't run out in the middle of surgery

<span style="font-size: 16px">Medical skill check: 100</span>
A vital organ. The patient's consciousness and Neurotrauma are directly linked to it. Unlike other organs, the brain is typically not transplanted.
The brain may be removed or transplanted during an Organ Transplant Surgery done on the head. Removal of the brain causes immediate Unconsciousness, Cardiac Arrest, Respiratory Arrest, loss of character control (the patient will enter freecam), and 100% Neurotrauma, and continuous rapid neurotrauma gain, all of which will persist as long as the organ is removed. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to neurotrauma, up to 100%. Removing a brain at 100% or more neurotrauma will not produce a brain transplant and the patient will immediately reach 200% neurotrauma, killing them.
If the brain is transplanted back into the patient, they will regain control of the character, but their Cardiac Arrest and Respiratory Arrest  must still be treated. If the brain is transplanted into another patient, the donor will take control of that patient.
Unlike other organs, the condition of the brain will always decay rapidly, even in a refrigerated container, unless it is placed in a Brain Jar. If the brain or the container it is in ever touches the ground, it will be destroyed, unless if it is in a brain jar.

A vital organ. The patient's heart-related afflictions, such as Heart Damage, are directly linked to it.
The heart may be removed or transplanted during an Organ Transplant Surgery done on the torso. Removal of the heart causes immediate Cardiac Arrest, 100% Heart Damage, and up to 20% Vanilla Organ Damage, inversely proportional to heart damage before removal. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to heart damage before removal. The patient cannot gain and will be immediately relieved of Cardiac Tamponade and Heart Attack while their heart is removed.
If a heart is transplanted back into the patient, their Heart Damage and up to 20% Vanilla Organ Damage, both inversely proportional to the condition of the organ, will be treated, but their Cardiac Arrest will not be treated. The patient may gain Organ Rejection if they receive the organ and their Immunity is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is toggled on in the mod config.
The condition of a heart will decay unless placed in a Refrigerated Container or Refrigerated Crate. While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change.

At 50% kidney damage, only one kidney has failed, while the other kidney will be functional. A patient may be healthy with only one kidney. By itself, 50% kidney damage will not cause lethal Hypertension.
The kidneys may be removed or transplanted during an Organ Transplant Surgery done on the torso.

The Multipurpose Scalpel combines the functionality of the regular scalpel, the organ procurement scalpels, and the trauma shears, while also providing the user with a way of intentionally harming the patient.
This item is craftable at a regular fabricator.
The mode of this Scalpel is changed by equipping the item (akin to a weapon or tool) and clicking on the available UI buttons which appear.

<span style="font-size: 16px">Mode: Surgery Incision</span>
In this mode, the item behaves identically to a regular Scalpel.

<span style="font-size: 16px">Mode: Bandages, Casts, Malpractice</span>
In this mode, as long as the patient has a bandage or a cast, the item functions identically to Trauma Shears.
Is this not the case, then using it will result in the patient getting stabbed. Depending on location and surgical status of the patient, this can cause serious damage.
Notable outcomes include:
- a chance for causing fractures in extremeties that are currently opened for surgery
- causing neurotrauma on opened heads
- causing specific organ damage and internal bleeding on opened torsos

<span style="font-size: 16px">Mode: Adaptive Organ Extraction</span>
In this mode, the item will have the ability to extract any organ from a patient, and it is a required item for Organ Transplant Surgery. The organ extracted depends on which limb has Retracted Skin, and which limb the Multipurpose Scalpel is used on:
Retracted skin: Torso
Left arm: Kidney Transplant
Torso: Liver Transplant
Right arm: Heart Transplant
Left leg: Lung Transplant
Retracted skin: Head
Head: Brain Transplant

For each poison being filtered, the condition of the filter reduces by 0.8/s, and there is a 0.1% chance per second for the patient to receive Sepsis. These effects do not occur if the patient is not poisoned.

<span style="font-size: 16px">Medical skill check: 30</span>
A pair of tweezers used to remove damaged tissue or bullets.
This item is not directly craftable. To obtain it from a fabricator, the player must craft the "Surgery toolbox (kit)".
Its effects depend on if:
there is Retracted Skin, gunshot wound or deep tissue injury on the limb (surgery use case)
or none of those apply (no surgery use case)

<span style="font-size: 16px">Application effects (no surgery):</span>
- minor Bleeding
- minor [lacerations](https://trello.com/c/RWzQPcQe/27-open-wounds "?")
- Intense Pain

<span style="font-size: 16px">Application success (surgery):</span>
- -3% to -10% [Internal damage](https://trello.com/c/tj9SaBlj/30-internal-wounds "?")
- -3% to -10% [Blunt force trauma](https://trello.com/c/tj9SaBlj/30-internal-wounds "?")
- -3% to -10% Foreign Bodies
- +5% [Lacerations](https://trello.com/c/RWzQPcQe/27-open-wounds "?")

<span style="font-size: 16px">Application failure (surgery):</span>
- +6% [Internal damage](https://trello.com/c/tj9SaBlj/30-internal-wounds "?")
The tweezers can work without Retracted Skin  if the limb you are tweezing has gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries, using the tweezer through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries will cause 5% Traumatic Shock . Do note that tweezing through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries only works on foreign bodies, and not on blunt force trauma. Tweezing out foreign bodies also has a 5% chance to yield scrap.
Using tweezers in cases where it otherwise wouldn't do anything will cause you to pinch the patient instead, causing minor damage which is worse if on the head.

<span style="font-size: 16px">Medical skill check: 60 (30 if the patient has Analgesia)</span>
The wrench is used to treat Dislocations. To use, drag it onto the dislocated limb in the health interface and use it as a treatment, like you would a bandage. If the limb has no dislocation, the wrench will not do anything.
The wrench can also be used to remove an Autopulse or Body Bag from a person, as long as they aren't Unconsciousness, by using the wrench on their torso as treatment. The item will be placed in the inventory of the wrench user.
Other vanilla wrenches are able to perform the same actions, including:
