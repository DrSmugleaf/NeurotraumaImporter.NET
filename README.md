# NeurotraumaImporter.NET
## About
NeurotraumaImporter.NET is a script to import Neurotrauma's Trello wiki into .md format for use in Obsidian.  
The Trello wiki is terrible and unreadable, this parses it into a format that's more easily used.  

There are two formats available:
- [Regular markdown](https://github.com/DrSmugleaf/NeurotraumaImporter.NET/blob/master/Import.md)
- [Obsidian markdown, with links for convenient in-file navigation.](https://github.com/DrSmugleaf/NeurotraumaImporter.NET/blob/master/Obsidian.md)

Keep in mind that if you are not using Obsidian, then the links in that version of the import will clutter the .md file and not be parsed correctly. These links make it possible to jump between different headers in Obsidian.
