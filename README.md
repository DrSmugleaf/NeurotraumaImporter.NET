# NeurotraumaImporter.NET
## About
NeurotraumaImporter.NET is a script to import Neurotrauma's Trello wiki into .md format for use in Obsidian.
The Trello wiki is terrible and unreadable, this parses it into a format that's more easily used.
[An example of the final .md file can be found here](https://github.com/DrSmugleaf/NeurotraumaImporter.NET/blob/master/Neurotrauma.md)
Keep in mind that if you are not using Obsidian, then the links will clutter the .md file and not be parsed correctly.
These links make it possible to jump between different headers in Obsidian.
