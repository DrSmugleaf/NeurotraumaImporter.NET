Neurotrauma is one of the only things that can deal direct damage to your health. Neurotrauma is extremely dangerous and can build up very quickly, and upon reaching 200%, will instantly kill the player. The brain will heal at a rate of 0.1% per second, assuming that the config is unchanged and nothing is damaging it.

This mechanic is off by default. It can be toggled in the mod’s config, found in the ESC menu while the mod is enabled.  
Organ rejection may occur when a patient receives an organ transplant while their [[#^Immunity|Immunity]] is higher than 10%. If organ rejection occurs, the organ that was transplanted will immediately gain 100% damage, making it useless.  
Reducing [[#^Immunity|Immunity]] is primarily done using [[#^Azathioprine|Azathioprine]].  
At 100% [[#^Immunity|Immunity]], the chance for organ rejection is 60%. The formula, where 1 is 100%, is as follows:

The second step in **all** surgical procedures. Having an unclamped (no [[#^ClampedBleeding|Clamped Bleeding]]) surgical incision will cause 0.7% [[#^BloodLoss|Blood Loss]]  per second for each incision, and having a surgical incision without [[#^Analgesia|Analgesia]] or another sedation method ( [[#^Unconsciousness|Unconsciousness]] or [[#^Anesthesia|Anesthesia]]) will cause 2% [[#^TraumaticShock|Traumatic Shock]] per second for each incision.

Traumatic shock can rapidly become fatal, and should your patient acquire this at any point, it is likely to be unintended. Traumatic shock will decrease in strength 4x as fast provided the victim is under the effects of [[#^Anesthesia|Anesthesia]], or has [[#^Analgesia|Analgesia]] while being near a [[#^SurgeryTable|Surgery Table]].  
If a character has [[#^RetractedSkin|Retracted Skin]] and the round ends (such as on docking to a station), the character will gain 5 minutes of traumatic shock immunity on the next round.  
  
  
<span style="font-size: 16px">Caused by:</span>  
- Performing unsafe surgery:  
  - [[#^SurgeryIncision|Surgery Incision]] without [[#^Analgesia|Analgesia]]  
  - Any other surgical step after Clamped Bleeders without sedation, such as being near a [[#^SurgeryTable|Surgery Table]] or having [[#^Anesthesia|Anesthesia]].  
- Using [[#^Tweezers|Tweezers]]  through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries (causes minor shock unless overused)

A vital organ. The patient’s consciousness and [[#^Neurotrauma|Neurotrauma]] are directly linked to it. Unlike other organs, the brain is typically not transplanted.  
The brain may be removed or transplanted during an [[#^OrganTransplantSurgery|Organ Transplant Surgery]] done on the head. Removal of the brain causes immediate [[#^Unconsciousness|Unconsciousness]], [[#^CardiacArrest|Cardiac Arrest]], [[#^RespiratoryArrest|Respiratory Arrest]], loss of character control (the patient will enter freecam), and 100% [[#^Neurotrauma|Neurotrauma]], and continuous rapid neurotrauma gain, all of which will persist as long as the organ is removed. The condition of the organ is inversely proportional to neurotrauma, up to 100%. Removing a brain at 100% or more neurotrauma will not produce a brain transplant and the patient will immediately reach 200% neurotrauma, killing them.  
If the brain is transplanted back into the patient, they will regain control of the character, but their [[#^CardiacArrest|Cardiac Arrest]] and [[#^RespiratoryArrest|Respiratory Arrest]]  must still be treated. If the brain is transplanted into another patient, the donor will take control of that patient.  
Unlike other organs, the condition of the brain will always decay rapidly, even in a refrigerated container, unless it is placed in a [[#^BrainJar|Brain Jar]]. If the brain or the container it is in ever touches the ground, it will be destroyed, unless if it is in a brain jar.

<span style="font-size: 16px">Medical skill check: 40</span>  
A pair of vital organs. The patient’s [[#^KidneyDamage|Kidney Damage]] is directly related to it. Unlike other organs, patients will have two kidneys, which are individually damaged. At 50% kidney damage, only one kidney has failed, while the other kidney will be functional. A patient may be healthy with only one kidney. By itself, 50% kidney damage will not cause lethal [[#^Hypertension|Hypertension]].  
The kidneys may be removed or transplanted during an [[#^OrganTransplantSurgery|Organ Transplant Surgery]] done on the torso. Removing the kidneys will remove both at once, causing 100%[[#^KidneyDamage|Kidney Damage]] and up to 20% [[#^VanillaOrganDamage|Vanilla Organ Damage]], inversely proportional to kidney damage before removal. The condition of the organs are inversely proportional to kidney damage before removal, up to 50% for each kidney. Therefore, removal of the kidneys at 25% kidney damage will produce one kidney at 100% and another one at 50%.  
If the kidneys are transplanted back into the patient, up to 50% [[#^KidneyDamage|Kidney Damage]] and up to 10% [[#^VanillaOrganDamage|Vanilla Organ Damage]] per kidney, both inversely proportional to their condition, will be treated. The patient may gain [[#^OrganRejection|Organ Rejection]] if they receive the organ and their [[#^Immunity|Immunity]] is higher than 10%, if the mechanic is enabled in the mod config.  
The condition of a kidney will decay unless placed in a [[#^RefrigeratedContainer|Refrigerated Container]] or [[#^RefrigeratedCrate|Refrigerated Crate]]. While refrigerated, the organ will slowly regain condition if it is above 90%, otherwise it will not change. If the organ or the container it is in is dropped from a large height, it will be destroyed.

An item used to correct the heartbeat of a patient. When used on a patient and charged with batteries, the defibrillator has a chance to either reset [[#^Fibrillation|Fibrillation]], cause [[#^CardiacArrest|Cardiac Arrest]], or cure cardiac arrest. Using any defibrillator on a human will stun them for one second.  
The chance for these is depicted in the graph below, with cyan being the chance to reset fibrillation, pink being the chance to cause cardiac arrest and orange being the chance to cure it. The X axis is medical skill and the Y axis is the chance to do something (with 1 being 100%).  
At medical skill below 80, the [[#^AutomatedExternalDefibrillatorAed|Automated External Defibrillator Aed]] has better chances in all regards. At 100 medical skill, the manual defibrillator is superior. Manual defibrillator becomes perfectly safe, and is guaranteed to cure cardiac arrest and fibrillation.

The table also has wiring pins that can be used to output important information, such as blood pressure, [[#^Acidosis|Acidosis]], heart rate, and breathing rate.  
The table has slots for three items:

The tweezers can work without [[#^RetractedSkin|Retracted Skin]]  if the limb you are tweezing has gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries, using the tweezer through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries will cause 5% [[#^TraumaticShock|Traumatic Shock]] . Do note that tweezing through gunshot wounds or deep tissue injuries only works on foreign bodies, and not on blunt force trauma. Tweezing out foreign bodies also has a 5% chance to yield scrap.  
Using tweezers in cases where it otherwise wouldn’t do anything will cause you to pinch the patient instead, causing minor damage which is worse if on the head.

The wrench is used to treat [[#^Dislocations|Dislocations]]. To use, drag it onto the dislocated limb in the health interface and use it as a treatment, like you would a bandage. If the limb has no dislocation, the wrench will not do anything.  
The wrench can also be used to remove an [[#^Autopulse|Autopulse]] or [[#^BodyBag|Body Bag]] from a person, as long as they aren’t [[#^Unconsciousness|Unconsciousness]], by using the wrench on their torso as treatment. The item will be placed in the inventory of the wrench user.  
Other vanilla wrenches are able to perform the same actions, including:
